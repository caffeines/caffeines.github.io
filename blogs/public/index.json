[{"content":"Git Worktrees: A Powerful Feature for Managing Multiple Working Directories Git worktrees are one of the most underutilized yet powerful features in Git. They allow us to maintain multiple working directories from a single Git repository, each with its own branch checked out. In this blog post, we’ll explore what worktrees are, their benefits, and how to effectively use them in your development workflow.\nWhat is a Git Worktree? A Git worktree is an additional working directory linked to our main repository. Think of it as a way to check out multiple branches simultaneously, each in its own directory, while sharing the same Git history and objects.\nThe main repository (where we run git worktree add) is called the \u0026ldquo;main working tree,\u0026rdquo; and any additional working directories we create are called \u0026ldquo;linked working trees.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen to Use Git Worktree Simultaneous Feature Development: Work on multiple features at once without needing to switch branches. Testing or Reviewing Pull Requests: Test or review a pull request while keeping our current work intact. Bug Fixes: Easily switch between the main branch and bug fix branches without losing progress. Experimentation: Create a separate worktree for experiments, keeping our main branch clean. Managing Legacy Branches: Maintain older versions of our software alongside active development. Easy Comparisons: Compare different branches side by side in separate directories. Reducing Clone Overhead: Avoid multiple clones of a repository; use worktrees to save space. Avoiding Merge Conflicts: Prevent merge conflicts by isolating work on different branches. Git Worktree Concepts Git worktree comes with several options; for this blog, we will focus on git worktree with branch only, as it’s the most common use case. The below commands we will be discussing in this post.\nWorktree Add Worktree List Worktree Remove Git Worktree Add To create a new worktree, use the following command:\ngit worktree add \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; \u0026lt;branch\u0026gt; Let’s assume we have a repository named worktree-demo in the projects folder and we are on a branch named feature:\nprojects/ ├── worktree-demo/ │ ├── .git │ ├── index.html │ ├── main.js Now we will create a new worktree from the worktree-demo repository:\ngit worktree add ../hotfix main This creates a new directory named hotfix with the main branch checked out.\nAfter creating a new worktree, the new project structure will look like this:\nprojects/ ├── worktree-demo/ │ ├── .git │ ├── index.html │ ├── main.js ├── hotfix/ │ ├── .git │ ├── index.html │ ├── main.js Git Worktree List To see all our current worktrees:\ngit worktree list Output:\n/Users/john/Workspace/worktree-demo a7f2163 [feature] /Users/john/Workspace/hotfix a7f2163 [main] Git Worktree Remove When we’re done with a worktree, we can remove it:\ngit worktree remove \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; For example:\n# if you are in hotfix directory (linked worktree) git worktree remove . # if you are in worktree-demo directory (main worktree) git worktree remove ../hotfix After deleting the linked worktree:\nprojects/ ├── worktree-demo/ │ ├── .git │ ├── index.html │ ├── main.js Give Git worktrees a try in your next project, and experience the benefits of this often-overlooked feature!\n","permalink":"https://sadat.me/blogs/posts/git/worktree/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"git-worktrees-a-powerful-feature-for-managing-multiple-working-directories\"\u003eGit Worktrees: A Powerful Feature for Managing Multiple Working Directories\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGit worktrees are one of the most underutilized yet powerful features in Git.
