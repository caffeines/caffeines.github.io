It is the delay between initiating a request and receiving the corresponding output. Lower latency is generally desirable, as it indicates quicker processing and better overall performance in computing tasks. Let’s talk about some common causes of CPU latency.
Inefficient Algorithm Inefficient algorithms can significantly impact CPU latency by prolonging the time it takes to execute tasks.</description>
